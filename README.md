## Top Projects

### Machine learning

- **[Image Classifer](https://github.com/OmriHarel19/image_classification_project)** - image classification application: convolutional neural network in python using KERAS api, inspired by google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

### Cyber Security

- **[HackThisGame](https://github.com/OmriHarel19/HackThisGame)** - A CTF game, embeded in a simple tic-tac-toe game. Each challange demonstrates a different vulnerability (such as: buffer overflow, format string attacks), and has its own documented python exploit.
